# The is test job based on spree 3.2.0

User Wishlist Question

There's an ecommerce system where we sell multiple products. There's a new feature which needs to be implemented.
Any user(guest and logged in both) can add any number of products to his wishlist. User should have an unique wishlist and they can share their wishlist with any number of users. And an user can add any number of products from the shared wishlist to their wishlist.
Note: If a guest user gets logged in then accordingly maintain the wishlist and they should be able to see their items which they have added while they were guests when they're logged in.

Please design an architecture for this using Spree and make sure each and every functionality of Spree works as it is. If not spree you can use any other rails framework.

Scope:
User Singin.
Unique wishlist.
Adding Products to wishlist.
Converting Guest user wishlist to Registered user wishlist.
